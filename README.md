Crypto Final
============

(Was basing protocol off of one of the sample finals, feel free to change
it, if you want to.)

To-Do:
* Add key swapping (was just going to have the parties send each other \
their public keys)
* Add encryption/decryption with keys
* Use implemented checksum function
* Specify protocol (Basically, just use what's provided in the sample)
